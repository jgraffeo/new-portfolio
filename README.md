# New Portfolio

For this portfolio, I wanted a sleek and simple design that is straight to the point and visually pleasing. I bought a template from ThemeForest to help with the aesthetic I was looking for due to time constraints and holes in my knowledge at this time.

# Why I Used A Template + Future Plans
* This portfolio is very similar to the original design I was creating for this project. I wanted to utilize a fixed navbar with a one-page portfolio using parallax scrolling features.
* I would like to learn from the code in this template to create a more customizable and personal portfolio that will be a better representation of my ideas and skills.

# Projects I Included + Why
* Musrch
* Train Scheduler
* Giphy API
* At the time of deployment, these three projects showcase my most in-depth projects. For example, the first, Musrch (a group effort), utilizes html, css, materialize, jquery, and three api calls.
